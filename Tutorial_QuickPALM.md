## Installing the QuickPALM ImageJ plugin ##

### Pre-requisites ###
QuickPALM depends on the free open-source program [ImageJ](http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) version 1.43o or higher (we recommend that you use the ImageJ menu option "Help > Update ImageJ..." to download the latest version not always directly available on their website). It is recommended to have ImageJ configured for optimal performance in your system, both the available memory and CPUs can be set in the ImageJ's menu "Edit > Options > Memory & Threads...".

### Installation ###
Simply copy the QuickPALM
